# 👋 Hello developer!

This is one of the many templates available from W3Schools. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). 🦄

This project serves as an example of what can be achieved. It is not a fully functional product. Feel free to use the source code and ideas as a starting point for your own projects.

## Knowledge requirements

To be able to fully understand and modify this template to your needs, there are several things you should know (or learn):

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)

## 🔨 What's next?

Customize this template to make it your own.  
Remember to make your layout responsive - if you want your site to look good on smaller screens like mobile.

## 🎨 Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.  
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

### Root HTML

There are only one important HTML file in this project which is the base page around the application. It is a bit different from a default React project as you can find the skeleton HTML `index.html` in the root folder instead of `public`.

### CSS and images

You can find the CSS for the application in `src/client/app.css`.

### Application

You can find the core frontend React application in `src/client`. Here you have a normal React setup with `index.js` as the glue that pieces the `.jsx` components together. You will have to know React to use this template.

### Backend

The backend logic is located under `src/server`. `src/server/index.js` is the main file handling the APIs. 

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   
Database creation, queries, and database connection can be found in `db/index.js`.

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## 🔨 Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
